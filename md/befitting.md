The hateful scorch of the midday sun seared his bare skin dry, and the arid wind parched his lips and stung his eyes. 
Loose rocks fell as he fixed his footing on a narrow ledge sticking out of the steep cliffside, just barely enough for a couple of toes.
He adjusted his weight to free one hand and as he did the tiny outcrop he held onto just moments ago fell into the depths, caught by the juniper bosk below. 
After making sure he would not fall, he took a waterskin from his belt and raised it hastily to his lips.
Empty. 
Not one miserable drop.
He reached for another jug, one he had pinched from a cleric on his way to the foothills, a tiny clay flask, white in colour, unassuming.
He uncorked it with his teeth and took a swing from what he thought would be a spirit. 
Salted, stale water filled his mouth and he had to spit it out.
He cursed, put the flask away and continued climbing.
His muscles strained and tore as he stretched to reach a bit of stone above his head.
First a few fingers, then he grabbed it with his hand.
The sharp, jagged edge of the white granite cleaved into his skin and as he scaled he left a bloodied trail of red handprints on the otherwise pale stone. 
And as he reached the summit he dragged himself up onto the plateau and with a heavy gasp rolled over onto his back. 

He wheezed for a while before getting up onto two feet but he almost collapsed again when he glimpsed the vile structure.
About a good thirty yards from him and the edge of the cliff a dark temple or tomb rose towards the sky, towering over the plateau.
It made not a pitiful attempt to seem like it belonged to its environment.
Its ebony bricks were so out of place among the peak's white granite, it looked as if the structure grew right out of the Abyss. 
The black stone drank the vigorous blaze of the sun and it ravenously gorged and devoured all the light that dared touch it.
Pale alone were the sun bleached skulls adorning the lintel of the gaping entrance.
He drew his axe from his belt, and slowly and warily marched towards the ziggurat.
A familiar stench of rot and decay vexed his senses and he stopped when he realised he had been watched.

He realised he had been watched as two dark figures amerged from the gaping cavity of the ziggurat.
As they stepped out of the harsh sunlgiht he could make out their horror.
A black moldy silk draped over them from head to toe, wrapping tightly around the giant figures.
The cloch had an opening in the middle where he could see their skeletal figures.
Flesh rotting, dark bones, empty sockets for eyees, exposed teeth for lips, eroded features.
With giant cleavers.

He lept towards one of the dark figures and with one dextreous swoop he choped its head off, which almost flew off but the tight hood catced it.
The second creature charged at him.
He broke its arm and it held its clearver limply.
With a quick turn he separated the torso form its legs without much resistance. 
The leather was like their old skin, pealed then draped over them again.
Like they wear wearing their old skins as clothing.
He took a deep breath and almost sheated his weapon when he noticed his two felled enemies rise again.
The leathery dark cloth which wrapped itself around the skeletal flesh of the creatures shrank and joined the head back into place.
The other's spine where pulled together until it could stand again.
What trickery!

The cloth streached and and controted like a wet cloth being twisted to drench.
It wasn't the bones that weer animated, but the cloth that wrap itself around them, like how mucle wraps around the bone of the lviing.
A pile of bones moved by marionetts by the very drape they wore.
The cloak twisted and the skeletons moved, lunched forward at him, raising their massive cleaver overhead.
He doged out of the way as they stroke down. 
He cut into their cloth but it did not split.
Another cleaver came for him and he was clumsy.
The dark blade left a gnasty gash on his soulder, it burnt his whole arm. 
He reared back and his oponenets also retreated.
They circled eachother until his back was to the entranece of the ziggurat.

Realisng he could not beat them in combat he bolted towards the temple's entrance.
Inside, to the two sides of the door was two oil pillars made of brass, burning a green fire.
He circled around and hid behind the pillars. 
Just as the skeletons enteredhe gave the pillar a shove and the burning liquid covered the two creatures, setting them ablaze.
They contorted and twisted and gave a frighful howl until the cloth fully burned up and nothing left just ash covered burnt bones falling to the ground.
He watched them burn, making sure they won't get up again before looking around.

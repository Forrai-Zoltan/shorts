The hateful scorch of the midday sun seared his bare skin dry, and the arid wind parched his lips and stung his eyes. 
Loose rocks fell as he fixed his footing on a narrow ledge sticking out of the steep cliffside, just barely enough for a couple of toes.
He adjusted his weight to free one hand and as he did the tiny outcrop he held onto just moments ago fell into the depths, caught by the juniper shrubs below. 
After making sure he would not slip, he took a waterskin from his belt and raised it hastily to his lips.
Empty. 
Not one miserable, wretched drop.
He reached for another jug, one he had pinched from a cleric on his way to the foothills.
It was a tiny clay flask, white in colour, unassuming.
He uncorked it with his teeth and took a swing from what he thought would be a spirit. 
Salted stale water filled his mouth and he had to spit it out.
He cursed, put the flask away and continued climbing.
His muscles strained and tore as he stretched to reach a bit of stone above his head.
First a few fingers, then he grabbed it with his hand.
The sharp, jagged edge of the white granite cleaved into his skin and as he scaled he left a bloodied trail of red handprints on the otherwise pale stone. 
And as he reached the summit he dragged himself up onto the plateau and rolled over onto his back.
